This is a GitHub Action to install the [Octopus CLI](https://octopus.com/docs/octopus-rest-api/octopus-cli) on runners and self-hosted environments. Once installed, the Octopus CLI may be used to issue commands to [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/). Subsequent actions may use the Octopus CLI, which is cached and available via `PATH`.

## What is the Octopus CLI?

The Octopus CLI is a command line tool that builds on top of the [Octopus REST API](https://octopus.com/docs/octopus-rest-api). It enables you to package applications for deployment and manage your environments, deployments, channels, projects, and workers in Octopus Deploy.

## Examples

To install the latest version of the Octopus CLI: 

```yml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - name: Install Octopus CLI 🐙
    uses: OctopusDeploy/install-octopus-cli-action@v1.1.6
    with:
      version: latest
```

To install a specific version of the Octopus CLI:

```yml
steps: 
  - uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - name: Install Octopus CLI 🐙 
    uses: OctopusDeploy/install-octopus-cli-action@v1.1.6
    with:
      version: 7.4.3140
```

Here's an example of invoking the `list-deployments` command after installing the Octopus CLI:

```yml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - name: Install Octopus CLI 🐙
    uses: OctopusDeploy/install-octopus-cli-action@v1.1.6
    with:
      version: 7.4.3190
  - name: list-octopusdeploy-deployments
    run: >
      octo list-deployments --server=${{ env.serverURL }}
        --apiKey=${{ secrets.apiKey }}
```
